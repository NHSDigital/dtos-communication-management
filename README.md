# Communication Management (National Screening Platform)

This repository makes up the NSP component that handles communication with NHS Notify.

At present, this component is processing a file, and then using the appointment data in that file to create an event, and calling NHS Notify with the payload.
In future, the file processing will be removed, and the event subscription will remain.

Here's a diagram:
